In this game, we have 16 sliding tiles which have different types. 
There are 4 type tiles (Starter, End, Pipe Static, Curved Pipe Static) which cannot move. They all have pipe. There are 2 
(Empty, Pipe) type tiles which can move. One of them has pipe and other one does not have 
pipe. 
Lastly, there is a empty tile. Movable tiles can move to the location of this empty tile.
Additionally, there is a ball which place at starter tile at the beginning of the game.
User should form a appropriate path with these tiles which have pipe from starting tile to ending 
tile. When this path is generated by user, the ball starts to move from starting point to ending 
point. This is how the level is passed. 
There are 5 levels. Each of the levels has different situation of the tiles. If all levels are passed, 
game over.
